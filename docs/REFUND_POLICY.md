# NNUE Registration Payment Refund Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the refund policy for all payments made through the NAPPS Nasarawa Unified Exams (NNUE) system, including direct student registration payments and coordinator slot purchases.

## Policy Statement

### NO REFUND POLICY
**All payments made through the NNUE platform are FINAL and NON-REFUNDABLE.**

This policy applies to:
- Student registration fees
- Coordinator slot purchases (50-slot and 100-slot packages)
- All payment processing fees
- Any additional charges or fees

## Rationale

1. **Administrative Processing**: Once payment is processed, administrative work begins immediately including:
   - Registration data processing
   - Document generation
   - System resource allocation
   - Third-party service fees

2. **Resource Allocation**: Payments result in immediate resource allocation:
   - Slot allocation for coordinators
   - Registration slot reservation
   - System processing resources
   - Database storage allocation

3. **Third-Party Costs**: Payment processing involves non-refundable third-party costs:
   - Payment gateway fees (Paystack)
   - Bank transaction charges
   - System processing costs

4. **Operational Integrity**: Refunds would compromise:
   - System financial integrity
   - Fair allocation of limited resources
   - Operational efficiency
