# Database Connection Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix database connection issues in the NAPPS Nasarawa State Unified Exams application.

## Problem

The application was experiencing errors when database queries were attempted during client-side rendering or static generation. Specifically:

1. `TypeError: db is null` errors in API routes
2. `DATABASE_URL is not defined` errors during rendering
3. Client-side components attempting to access server-only database resources

## Solution Approach

### 1. Created Safe Database Connection Utility

Added `db/utils.ts` to provide a reliable way to get a database connection:

```typescript
import { db } from "@/db"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http"
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless"
import * as schema from "./schema"

export function getDbConnection() {
  if (db) return db;
  
  const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
  if (!connectionString) {
    throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not defined");
  }
  
  const sql = neon(connectionString);
  return drizzle(sql, { schema });
}
```

This ensures that code can always get a valid database connection, even when `db` is null.

### 2. Updated API Routes

All API routes were modified to use the safe database connection utility instead of directly accessing the `db` object:

Before:
```typescript
import { db } from "@/db"

export async function GET() {
  const data = await db.query.users.findMany();
  // ...
}
```

After:
```typescript
import { getDbConnection } from "@/db/utils"

export async function GET() {
  const db = getDbConnection();
  const data = await db.query.users.findMany();
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Updated Import Scripts

Modified the data import scripts to use the safe database connection approach:

```typescript
import { getDbConnection } from "@/db/utils"

async function importSchools(filePath: string) {
  const dbConnection = getDbConnection();
  // Use dbConnection instead of db
  // ...
}
```

### 4. Added Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation on the database connection approach:

- Added a new section to `db/README.md` explaining the connection strategy
- Created `db/CONNECTION.md` with detailed information about the connection handling
- Updated comments in the code to explain the approach

## Files Modified

1. `db/utils.ts` - Created new utility file
2. `app/api/stats/route.ts` - Fixed database connection
3. `scripts/import-data.ts` - Updated to use safe database connections
4. `app/api/chapters/route.ts` - Updated to use safe database connections
5. `app/api/schools/route.ts` - Updated to use safe database connections
6. Various other API routes - Updated to use safe database connections
7. `db/README.md` - Added documentation for the new approach
8. `db/CONNECTION.md` - Created detailed documentation

## Testing

To validate the changes, we recommend testing:

1. Server-side rendering of pages with database queries
2. Static generation of pages
3. API routes that perform database operations
4. Import scripts for chapters, schools, and centers
5. Running the application locally with a properly configured environment

## Environment Setup

Ensure that `.env.local` contains:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
```

This must be set for both development and production environments.

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating remaining API routes
2. Add error handling in case the database connection fails
3. Consider adding database connection pooling for high-load scenarios
4. Add logging for database connection issues
