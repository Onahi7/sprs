# Coordinator Slot Registration System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the 8-step implementation plan for the coordinator slot-based registration system. This feature allows coordinators to purchase slots (50 or 100) for direct student registration through their portal.

## Feature Requirements
- Coordinators can purchase slots of 50 or 100 students
- Each chapter has specific Paystack split codes for payments
- After successful payment, coordinators get slots to register students
- Registration form should be lateral (single page), not step-by-step
- Students can download registration slips after registration
- Slots reset after they've been used for registrations
- User-friendly interface on coordinator dashboard

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema & Foundation Setup âœ…
**Objective**: Create the database foundation for slot management
- [ ] Create `coordinator_slots` table to track purchased slots
- [ ] Create `slot_purchases` table to track payment history  
- [ ] Add `chapter_split_codes` table for Paystack split codes
- [ ] Update coordinators table with current slot balance
- [ ] Add necessary indexes and relationships
- [ ] Create migration scripts

### Step 2: Slot Purchase Interface
**Objective**: Build the UI for coordinators to purchase slots
- [ ] Create slot selection UI (50/100 slots options)
- [ ] Display current slot balance on coordinator dashboard
- [ ] Show slot pricing and chapter-specific information
- [ ] Add purchase confirmation modal
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/desktop

### Step 3: Paystack Payment Integration
**Objective**: Integrate payment processing with split codes
- [ ] Implement Paystack payment with chapter-specific split codes
- [ ] Handle payment success/failure callbacks
- [ ] Update slot balance after successful payment
- [ ] Send payment confirmation emails
- [ ] Add payment verification and security measures

### Step 4: Slot Management System
**Objective**: Create the logic for tracking and managing slots
- [ ] Create slot tracking logic (deduction on registration)
- [ ] Add slot balance validation before registration
- [ ] Implement slot usage history
- [ ] Add low slot balance notifications
- [ ] Create slot expiration logic (if needed)

### Step 5: Lateral Student Registration Form
**Objective**: Build single-page registration form for coordinators
- [ ] Design single-page registration form (not step-by-step)
- [ ] Include all necessary student fields in one view
- [ ] Add real-time validation
- [ ] Integrate with existing student registration logic
- [ ] Add bulk upload capabilities

### Step 6: Registration Slip Generation
**Objective**: Enable registration slip creation and download
- [ ] Create registration slip PDF template
- [ ] Implement download functionality
- [ ] Add QR codes for verification
- [ ] Store slip generation history
- [ ] Add print-friendly formats

### Step 7: Slot Usage Tracking & Analytics
**Objective**: Provide insights and management tools
- [ ] Add usage analytics for coordinators
- [ ] Implement slot reset functionality
- [ ] Create reporting dashboard
- [ ] Add bulk registration capabilities
- [ ] Create administrative oversight tools

### Step 8: UI/UX Polish & Testing
**Objective**: Finalize and optimize the complete system
- [ ] Improve user experience and interface
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation and user guides

## Technical Considerations

### Database Design
- Use proper indexing for performance
- Implement proper foreign key relationships
- Add audit trails for slot transactions
- Consider data archiving for historical records

### Security
- Validate all payment callbacks
- Implement proper access controls
- Add rate limiting for slot purchases
- Secure PDF generation and downloads

### Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Consider pagination for large datasets
- Optimize PDF generation process

### User Experience
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear error messages and feedback
- Intuitive navigation flow
- Accessibility compliance

## Success Metrics
- Coordinator adoption rate
- Time reduction in student registration process
- Payment success rate
- User satisfaction scores
- System performance metrics
